/// <reference types="react-scripts" />

/// WHAT DOES THIS FILE DO???

/// <reference types="..." /> directive declares a dependency on a package.

// The process of resolving these package names is similar to the process of resolving module names in an import statement. An easy way to think of these triple-slash-reference-types directives is as an import for declaration packages.

// For example, including /// <reference types="node" /> in a declaration file declares that this file uses names declared in @types/node/index.d.ts and thus, this package needs to be included in the compilation along with the declaration file.

// Use these directives only when youâ€™re authoring a d.ts file by hand. More information: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html

// In your case, /// <reference types="react-scripts" /> imports various names declared in the node_modules/react-scripts/lib/react-app.d.ts file.
